CIT Developer Documentations

To add new files please first add the file with the jekyll prefered naming (year-month-day-title.md) to the _posts directory in the master branch,
check everything with the supervisor and then merge it to the gh-pages branch to get it deployed.

**Never** merge the gh-pages branch into the master, we want the master to be clean.
