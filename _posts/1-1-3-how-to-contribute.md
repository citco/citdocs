If you think something is missing in these documentations, please go ahead and add your improvements. But to make sure all team members are aware of what you are going to change and to give them the opportunity to discuss these changes before publishing them, do not directly change anything in gh-pages branch. Instead:  

1. Create a draft branch from **gh-pages** branch (and not any other branch)
2. Apply your changes on this new branch
3. Push this new branch to repository so everyone can these changes and give their opinion
4. After discussing these changes with other team members, if everything is OK and changes are approved, then merge this draft branch to gh-pages branch
5. Delete draft branch from repository

_As a rule of thumb, never commit anything dirctly to **gh-pages** branch_
